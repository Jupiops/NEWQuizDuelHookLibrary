Hooks into the [NEW QuizDuel!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.maginteractive.quizduel2) android
application and applies some nice features

## Loading the libhook.so

First we need to compile our project.

* Edit params.txt & paste your ndk-build **path location** on the very first line and the **project location** on the
  second line like I did.
* Start Build.bat and follow instructions.
* Once compiled you'll have 2 new file in x32 and x64 named **libs** and **obj**. In order to load your <b>
  libhook.so</b>, you'll need to decompile the apk, you can use Apk Easy Tool for this.
* Go to *libs* and copy the created libhook.so in the *lib* folder of your game.
* Navigate to "<b>/smali_classes3</b>" & copy the loadLib from this git inside of that folder.
* Open the AndroidManifest.xml file in the decompiled apk and search this

```xml
android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"
```

it will give us the path of the MainActivity so in our case it's at
"<b>com.google.firebase.MessagingUnityPlayerActivity</b>" but using "<b>com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity</b>"
as it's stated in most other tutorials is working fine too.

* Open the file you've chosen with Notepad++ or any other preferred text editing software and search something like
  this:

```smali
.method protected onCreate(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V
    .locals 2
```

* Once found, paste this code under .locals 2:

```smali
invoke-static {}, Lcom/loadLib/libLoader;->loadLib()V
```

* Step 1: Recompile the apk
* Step 2: Profit
